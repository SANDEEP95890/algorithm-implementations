# Algorithm Implementations

This is a repo where I upload my implementations of various algorithms we examine on our school. I also add homework files when it is applicable(i.e. if homework requires programming, I upload its programming part.). So far, I have implemented these:

## Sorting Algorithms  

These algorithm implementations can be found on sorts.h file.

1. Insertion Sort  
    An in-place sorting algorithms with worst case running time scenario O(n^2).
2. Merge Sort  
    An algorithm that uses divide and conquer. Its running time is Big Theta(nlgn)
3. Quick Sort  
    Another sorting algorithm that uses divide and conquer method. Worst case running time O(n^2) but expected running time is O(nlgn).
